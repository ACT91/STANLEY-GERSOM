# Payment Integration Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- **Added `owner_email` field** to `vehicles` table to store vehicle owner's email
- **Added `payment_intent_id` field** to `violations` table to track Stripe payments
- **Updated `payment_method` enum** to include 'stripe' as a payment option
- Created migration file: `database/migration_add_email_payment.sql`

### 2. Backend API Changes

#### New Files Created:
- `api/config/env.php` - Loads environment variables from .env file
- `api/payments/confirm-payment.php` - Confirms payment and sends e-ticket via email
- `composer.json` - PHP dependencies (Stripe SDK and PHPMailer)

#### Modified Files:
- `api/get-or-create-vehicle.php` - Now accepts and stores owner_email
- `api/payments/create-payment-intent.php` - Already existed, now properly integrated

#### Environment Configuration:
- Updated `.env` with Stripe API keys and SMTP email configuration

### 3. Flutter App Changes

#### New Files Created:
- `lib/screens/payment_page.dart` - Payment page with Stripe integration

#### Modified Files:
- `lib/screens/vehicle_registration_page.dart` - Added email field
- `lib/screens/issue_violation_page.dart` - Navigates to payment page after issuing violation
- `lib/services/api_service.dart` - Added payment methods (createPaymentIntent, confirmPayment)
- `lib/main.dart` - Initialize Stripe with publishable key
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added flutter_stripe dependency
- `.env` - Added Stripe publishable key

## How It Works

### Complete Flow:

1. **Vehicle Registration**
   - Officer scans/enters license plate
   - If vehicle not found, registration form appears
   - Officer enters: Owner Name, Phone, **Email**, and Vehicle Type
   - Vehicle is registered with email stored in database

2. **Issue Violation**
   - Officer selects violation type and enters location
   - Violation is recorded in database with status 'pending'
   - App automatically navigates to Payment Page

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Payment page displays violation details and amount
   - Officer/Driver clicks "Pay Now"
   - Stripe payment sheet appears
   - User enters card details (Visa/Mastercard)
   - Payment is processed through Stripe

4. **Payment Confirmation**
   - Backend verifies payment with Stripe
   - Updates violation status to 'paid'
   - Sends e-ticket to vehicle owner's email
   - Shows success message

5. **E-Ticket Email**
   - Contains all violation details
   - Shows payment confirmation
   - Includes ticket number for records

## Setup Requirements

### Before Running:

1. **Install PHP Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd "Malawi Police Traffic Management"
   composer install
   ```

2. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```sql
   source database/migration_add_email_payment.sql
   ```

3. **Configure Backend .env:**
   - Add Stripe Secret Key
   - Add SMTP email credentials

4. **Install Flutter Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd product_verification
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Configure Flutter .env:**
   - Add Stripe Publishable Key
   - Update API_BASE_URL if needed

## Testing

### Test Cards (Stripe Test Mode):
- **Success:** 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline:** 4000 0000 0000 0002
- Any future expiry, any CVC, any postal code

### Test Email:
Use a real email address when registering vehicles to receive e-tickets.

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in .env files (not committed to git)
- Stripe handles all card data (PCI compliant)
- Emails sent via secure SMTP
- Payment verification done server-side

## Next Steps

1. Get Stripe API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Configure email SMTP (Gmail App Password recommended)
3. Run database migration
4. Install dependencies
5. Test with test cards
6. Switch to live keys for production
